      "I still think the embargo against Cuba is stupid and plays into the hands of our geopolitical rivals. It also leaves economic benefits on the table, which is also stupid considering how interconnected they are in our world. We should want Cuba as an ally, I don't think that even if the participant showed up, they could have made any argument to at least change my mind on what the facts are. And I doubt I would suddenly interpret the facts differently because someone that follows basically a cult leader says it's a bad idea while offering no actual reason for it. Lifting some of the embargo was one of Obama's actual achievements. I think it was reversed only because it was an achievement by what Trump considers a political rival, as well, Trump was being advised by Putin on the subject, so there you go. "
